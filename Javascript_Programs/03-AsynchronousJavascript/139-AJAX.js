// BASIC THEORY 

// AJAX : asynchronous javascript And XML
// HTTPRequest : Communication b/w Cliend and Server
// API : Application Programming Interface
// JSON : Javascript Object Notation

// With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) 
// without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page

// We don't use data in XML format anymore. 
// we use JSON now. 

// we have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server
// 1.) XMLHttpRequest (old way of doing)
// 2.) fetch API (new way of doing)
// 3.) axios (this is third party library)

// Representational State Transfer(REST) API also known as RESTful API is a set of architectural constraints not a protocol or a standard
