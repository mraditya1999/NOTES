=> JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. 
=> JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g.functional programming) styles.
=> Ecma Intenational => Organization that creates standards for technologies
=> Ecma-262 => standard published by Ecma International. It contains the specification for a scripting language
=> Ecmascript => specifications defined in ECMA-262 for creating a scripting language
=> Javascript => A general purpose scripting language  that conforms to  the ECMAScript specifications
=> BOM => All globla JS objects,functions and variables with var keyword automatically become members of the window object
=> Method => A function associated  with object knows as method
=> Hoisting =>is a process where the interpreter move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.
=> Document Object Model(DOM) => is an Application Programming Interface(API) for manipulating HTML and XML documents
=> In single array we can store multiple datatypes let arr = [12,"string",true,null,undefined]
=> function take function as argument and invoke it, is called callback function
Object Oriented  Programming(OOPs)
=> DRY => Don't Repeat Yourself
=> Encapsulation => means wrapping up data and member functions(method) together into a single unit
=> Abstraction => is a process of showing only necessary features of an entity/object and hidethe other irrelevant information.
=> Inheritance => allows a class(subclass) to acquire the properties and behaviour of another class(super-class)
=> Polymorphism => A subclass can define its own unique behaviour and still share the same functionalities of its parent/base class
=> Prototypes => are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another
Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype.The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain.
Prototype doesn't work on arrow functions
