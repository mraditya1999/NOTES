// Three types of Error
// 1. Compile time error
// 2. Logical error
// 3. Run time error

// Compile time error occurs due to syntax error.
// Logical error occurs due to logical error in the program.
// Run time error occurs due to invalid input or invalid operation.

// Run time error is also called as Exception.
// Exception Handling in C++ is a process to handle runtime errors. We perform exception handling so the normal flow of the application can be maintained even after runtime errors.

// In C++, exception is an event or object which is thrown at runtime. All exceptions are derived from std::exception class. It is a runtime error which can be handled. If we don't handle the exception, it prints exception message and terminates the program.

// Advantages of Exception Handling
// It maintains the normal flow of the application. In such case, rest of the code is executed even after exception.
