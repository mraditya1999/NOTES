// Genearalization and Specialization

// Generalization is the process of extracting shared characteristics from two or more classes, and combining them into a generalized superclass. Shared characteristics can be attributes, associations, or methods. This is a bottom-up approach to class design.(shapes->circle, rectangle, square)
// Purpose of generalization is to achieve polymorphism.

// Specialization is the process of creating new subclasses from an existing class. The new subclasses are more specific than the existing class. Specialization is the opposite of generalization.  This is  a top-down approach to class design.(rectangle->cuboid, parallelogram)
// Purpose of specialization is to share its attributes and methods with its subclasses.
