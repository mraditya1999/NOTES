// Abstract classes are the way to achieve abstraction in C++. Abstraction in C++ is the process to hide the internal details and showing functionality only. Abstraction can be achieved by two ways:

// Abstract class
// Interface

// Abstract class is a class which has at least one pure virtual function. A pure virtual function is a virtual function with no body. Abstract class cannot be instantiated. It can be used as a base class only. It is used to achieve abstraction and also to provide a common interface for derived classes.

// Data Abstraction is a process of providing only the essential details to the outside world and hiding the internal details, i.e., representing only the essential details in the program.
// Data Abstraction is a programming technique that depends on the seperation of the interface and implementation details of the program.
