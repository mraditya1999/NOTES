// If we create two or more members having the same name but different in number or type of parameter, it is known as overloading.

// we can overload:
// 1.methods,
// 2.constructors, and
// 3.indexed properties

// Types of overloading in C++ are:
// 1.Function overloading
// 2.Operator overloading

// Function Overloading is defined as the process of having two or more function with the same name, but different in parameters is known as function overloading

// Operator overloading is a compile-time polymorphism in which the operator is overloaded to provide the special meaning to the user-defined data type.
