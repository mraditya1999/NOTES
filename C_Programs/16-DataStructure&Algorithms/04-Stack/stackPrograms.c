1. Write a program to implement a stack using a linked list.
2. Write a program to convert the expression “a+b” into “ab+”.
3. Write a program to convert the expression “a+b” into “+ab”.
4. Write a program to implement a stack that stores names of students in the class.
5. Write a program to input two stacks and compare their contents.
6. Write a program to compute F(x, y), where F(x, y) = F(x-y, y) + 1 if y£x And F(x, y) = 0 if x<y
7. Write a program to compute F(n, r) where F(n, r) can be recursively defined as: F(n, r) = F(n–1, r) + F(n–1, r–1)
8. Write a program to compute Lambda(n) for all positive values of n where Lambda(n) can be recursively defined as: Lambda(n) = Lambda(n/2) + 1 if n>1 and Lambda(n) = 0 if n =1
9. Write a program to compute F(M, N) where F(M, N) can be recursively defined as: F(M,N) = 1 if M=0 or M≥N≥1 and F(M,N) = F(M–1 N) + F(M–1, N–1), otherwise
10. Write a program to reverse a string using recursion.
